  Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of
  the longest peak in the array.
  
  A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are 
  strictly increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which
  point they become  decreasing. At least three integers are required to
  form a peak.
  

function longestPeak(array) {
	let length = 0;
  let longest;
  let i = 1;
  while (i < array.length - 1) {
		if (!(array[i - 1] < array[i] && array[i] > array[i + 1])) {
			i ++;
			continue;
		}
		
    let l = i - 1;
    let r = i + 1;
    while (l >= 0 && array[l] > array[l - 1]) {
        l --;
    }
    while (r < array.length && array[r] > array[r + 1]) {
        r ++;
    }
    longest = r - l + 1;
		
		length = Math.max(longest, length)
    i = r;
    } 
  return length;
}
